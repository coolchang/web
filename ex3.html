  <p>"Investors are focusing on two trades –- shorting the yuan and China’s rates and they will keep pushing the yuan weaker until the People’s Bank of China steps in to intervene heavily, said Zhou Hao, senior emerging market economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore. If the yuan breaches 7 per dollar, the currency will likely tumble much faster and send shockwaves across markets, hurting stocks as well.China’s markets have been rocked by the threat of a trade war with the U.S., which escalated Thursday as the Trump administration warned of more pain unless Beijing changes its economic system. China has said it will retaliate to further U.S. action.Stocks Extend LossesEquity markets in Hong Kong fell on Friday, while they were mixed on the mainland. Hang Seng heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd. rose 1.6 percent, breaking a six day slide. The Chinese Internet giant has fallen 18 percent in less than two months. Several analysts cut their price targets on Tencent last month, while Morgan Stanley removed the stock from its focus list on Thursday. Still, all 51 analysts tracked by Bloomberg have the equivalent of buy ratings on the stock."
