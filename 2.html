<h2>Formulaic Sequence</h2>
<p><strong>A formulaic sequence</strong> is "a sequence, continuous or discontinuous, of words or other elements, which is, or appears to be, prefabricated: that is, stored and retrieved whole from memory at the time of use, rather than being subject to generation or analysis by the language grammar."</p>
