<p>2  What is Fluency? Broad vs. narrow definition (Lennon, 1990) Broad vs. narrow definition (Lennon, 1990) –Broad: general oral proficiency –Narrow: speed and smoothness of oral delivery The rapid, smooth, accurate, lucid, and efficient translation of thought or communicative intention into language under the temporal constraints of on- line processing (Lennon, 2000, p. 26) The rapid, smooth, accurate, lucid, and efficient translation of thought or communicative intention into language under the temporal constraints of on- line processing (Lennon, 2000, p. 26) Fluency is Fluency is –a characteristic of the speaker’s speech: performance fluency –a characteristic of the speaker: cognitive fluency (Segalowitz, 2000)
</p>
<p>3  Characteristics of a Fluent Speaker Oral production poses greater working memory demands than written production Oral production poses greater working memory demands than written production Fluent speech requires automatization of processes (e.g., Lennon, 2000; Segalowitz, 2000; Towell, Hawkins & Bazergui, 1996) Fluent speech requires automatization of processes (e.g., Lennon, 2000; Segalowitz, 2000; Towell, Hawkins & Bazergui, 1996) WM demands are also lowered by the use of prefabricated chunks of language, such as formulaic sequences (FSs): WM demands are also lowered by the use of prefabricated chunks of language, such as formulaic sequences (FSs): –FSs = Continuous or discontinuous sequences of words, which are, or appear to be, prefabricated (cf. Wray, 2002, p. 9)
</p>
<p>4  Characteristics of Fluent Speech There are many measures of fluency, including: There are many measures of fluency, including: A.Length of fluent runs – Number of syllables between pauses B.Length of pauses C.Phonation/time ratio – % of time filled with speech D.Articulation rate – Syllables per minute (Towell et al., 1996)
</p>
<p>5  Formulaic Sequences and Fluency Formulaicity aids the speaker’s production (Wray, 2000) : Formulaicity aids the speaker’s production (Wray, 2000) : –Manipulates information (e.g., mnemonics) –Buys time for processing and provides textual bulk –Creates a shorter processing route –Organizes, and signals the organization, of discourse If FSs are chunks, they can be produced without pauses, contributing to the “smoothness” of speech (cf. Wood, 2006) If FSs are chunks, they can be produced without pauses, contributing to the “smoothness” of speech (cf. Wood, 2006)
</p>
<p>6  How Formulaic Sequences are Learned Wray (2002): L1 is learned holistically, but (older) L2 learners process FSs at the word level: Wray (2002): L1 is learned holistically, but (older) L2 learners process FSs at the word level: –Incorrect formulaic sequence use is a result of constructing the sequence from parsed speech Towell et al. (1996): Language is proceduralized into grammatically correct chunks. If the structure of a FS is incorrect, it has not been proceduralized. Towell et al. (1996): Language is proceduralized into grammatically correct chunks. If the structure of a FS is incorrect, it has not been proceduralized. –However, L2 speaker often use many idiosyncratic, ungrammatical sequences (Oppenheim, 2000) So L2 learners need to use formulaic sequences repeatedly to be able to retrieve them as chunks. So L2 learners need to use formulaic sequences repeatedly to be able to retrieve them as chunks.

<p>7  Research Questions Does a pretraining of formulaic sequences lead to an increase in their use in subsequent speaking activities (fluency training)? Does a pretraining of formulaic sequences lead to an increase in their use in subsequent speaking activities (fluency training)? If so, does fluency increase? If so, does fluency increase? –Effortless use of formulaic sequences frees up cognitive resources for sentence structure planning, which in turn may lead to an overall more fluent performance in terms of speed and pausing patterns

<p>11  Selection of Formulaic Sequences From Nattinger & DeCarrico (1992) From Nattinger & DeCarrico (1992) Typical for spoken discourse Typical for spoken discourse Learnability: familiar words; transparent meaning; length Learnability: familiar words; transparent meaning; length Usefulness for fluency: length Usefulness for fluency: length Discourse function can be elicited Discourse function can be elicited Not used yet; not taught Not used yet; not taught
</p>
<p>12  Selection of Formulaic Sequences From Nattinger & DeCarrico (1992) From Nattinger & DeCarrico (1992) Types of sequences Types of sequences –Typical for spoken discourse –Fluency devices and discourse devices Discourse devices: Connect meaning and structure of discourse Discourse devices: Connect meaning and structure of discourse Fluency devices: Help to fill time with speech, to buy time, and to hold the floor Fluency devices: Help to fill time with speech, to buy time, and to hold the floor Learnability Learnability –Sequences consist of familiar words only –Meaning is transparent (not: by and large) –Not too long (not: I’m getting ahead of myself here)
</p>
<p>13  Selection of Formulaic Sequences (2) Usefulness for fluency Usefulness for fluency –Not too short, so they provide time to think –Not too long, so that they can easily be remembered entirely and correctly (!) Discourse function that could be elicited by the topics of the speaking activities Discourse function that could be elicited by the topics of the speaking activities –Give an example, give an opinion, indicate the order

<p>14  Formulaic Sequences Pretraining One 50-minute session 1.Listening: One-minute speech that contained the ten formulaic sequences (“common phrases”) 1.Three comprehension questions 2.Fill-in-the-blanks; blanks are words from formulaic sequences 3.Check answers, with focus on function words 2.Function: Categorizing the sequences according to meaning/function
</p>
<p>15  Formulaic Sequences Pretraining (cont.) 3.Grammatical structure and intonation: Explanation and modeling of the relationship between grammatical structure and intonation 4.Speaking: One to two minutes about a given topic. Use five sequences; a partner checks off the sequences from the list. Then switch roles.

<p>18  Results: Use of Formulaic Sequences Most students attempted to use at least one formulaic sequence (max. 20 students) Most students attempted to use at least one formulaic sequence (max. 20 students) –Session A total: 12 students (avg. 5.7 attempts) –Session B total: 15 students (avg. 7.3 attempts) And one student in the No Pretraining condition had one attempt And one student in the No Pretraining condition had one attempt –Session C total: 15 students (avg. 4.9 attempts) Four out of five students who did not use any trained formulaic sequences, did use more untrained sequences Four out of five students who did not use any trained formulaic sequences, did use more untrained sequences
</p>
<p>19  Results: Formulaic Sequences and Fluency Results from Session B only: most FSs per speech Students who used more trained formulaic sequences tended to have longer pauses: Students who used more trained formulaic sequences tended to have longer pauses: –2-min. speech: r =.315, p =.074 (trend) –Lower fluency However, their fluent runs were longer (but only for FSs with grammatical errors) However, their fluent runs were longer (but only for FSs with grammatical errors) –2-min. speech: r =.408, p =.018 –3-min. speech: r =.414, p =.015 –Higher fluency The trained formulaic sequences seem not to be used automatically; students need to pause to use them The trained formulaic sequences seem not to be used automatically; students need to pause to use them
